# SeaSecure UB – Web Project Context for AI Assistant (Codex)

## Overview
This project is a simple, clean, static website built using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The website is created as part of a school assignment for the subject **Informasjonsteknologi 1 (IT1)** and is connected to the **SeaSecure UB** student business.

The website should present SeaSecure's business idea clearly and professionally.

## Purpose
The goal is to develop a functional, responsive, and visually appealing website that:
1. Explains the product (life jacket with built-in GPS)
2. Shows the target audience
3. Helps with business presentation and marketing
4. Can be shown in my portfolio

## Target Audience
- Business partners
- Investors
- Schools & UB competitions
- Potential customers (boat owners, parents)

## Technical Scope
- No frameworks (no React, Vite, TS)
- No backend
- Static site only: HTML, CSS, JS
- Must work on mobile (responsive design)

## Design Source

## Rules for Codex / AI Assistant
When helping with code:
- Always prefer clean, readable code
- Use semantic HTML (header, main, section, footer)
- Prefer Flexbox / Grid
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Use descriptive class names (BEM recommended)
- Always ensure responsive behavior
